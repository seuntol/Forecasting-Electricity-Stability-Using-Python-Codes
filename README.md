# Forecasting-System-Stability-Using-Python-Codes

The presentation will employ exploratory data analysis (EDA) by developing Pandas Profiling report. We will identify and explain at least 3 key insights from the UCI_Dataset.csv dataset from the Pandas Profile.
Though not reflected in our slides, isolation forest was used to remove anomalies in our dataset.
We will develop two learning curves for the Logistic regression and the Gaussian Naïve Bayes and explain two key insights from each of them.
We will create the optimized models for The Logistical regression and Naïve Bayes. We will present the resulting Classification Report and ROC/AUC of each optimized model and explain 3 insights of each.
For our Ensemble voting model, we will explain the result and compare it to the other two optimized model. 
We will recommend one of the model to Mr. John Hughes and suggest two next steps that could help enhance the usability of the model.
